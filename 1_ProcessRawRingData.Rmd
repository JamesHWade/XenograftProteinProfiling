## Part 1: Processing Raw Data

I divided microring resonator data analysis into three R programs. This tutorial 
will cover the first of those files: **1_ProcessRawRingData.R**. The program
consists of 12 custom functions that take raw data from a single run and outputs
4 plots.

The `RawGo` function executes all 12 custom functions.

```{r echo = TRUE}
RawGo <- function(location = 'plots', getName = TRUE){
	# load relevant libraries
	library(ggplot2)
	library(readr)
	library(RColorBrewer)
	library(dplyr)
	library(outliers)

	# get working directory to reset at end of function
	directory <- getwd()

	name <- GetName()

	# only run RemoveRings if location is not plots
	if(location != 'plots'){
		RemoveRings(loc = location)
	} else{
		AggData()
	}
	ThermalControl(loc = location)
	PlotRingData(loc = location)
	GetNetShifts(loc = location)
	PlotNetShifts(loc = location)
	GetAvgShifts(loc = location)
	PlotAvgShifts(loc = location)
	FindBadClusters(loc = location)
	PlotBadClusters(loc = location)
	IdentifyOutliers(loc = location)

	setwd(directory)
}
```

In order to install all relevant libraries, run `install.packages(c("ggplot2", 
"reader", "RColorBrewer", "dplyr", "outliers"))` in the console.
